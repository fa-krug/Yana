# Development Workflow

## Communication Style

**Be concise and direct:**
- Get straight to the point - no preambles like "I'll help you with..."
- Skip acknowledgments - just do the task
- Use brief explanations - code speaks louder than words
- Don't repeat information already in conversation

## Before Implementing

**Clarify unclear requirements first.** When in doubt about:
- Implementation details or scope
- Expected behavior or edge cases
- Dependencies or data models
- Breaking changes

Ask before coding.

## Planning Complex Tasks

For multi-step tasks, create a plan:

```markdown
## Goal
[What needs to be accomplished]

## Steps
1. [Action with affected files]
2. [Action with affected files]

## Files to Modify
- `path/to/file.ts` - [What changes]

## Questions
- [Any unclear requirements]
```

## Token Efficiency

- **Limit file reading** - Use `offset`/`limit` for large files
- **Grep before Read** - Search first, then read specific files
- **Skip dependencies** - Don't read node_modules, .git
- **Batch operations** - Combine related edits

## File Size Limits

**MANDATORY: Keep files under 500 lines of code (LOC).**

- **Maximum file size**: 500 LOC per file
- **When a file exceeds 500 LOC**: Refactor by extracting functionality into separate modules/classes
- **Refactoring approach**:
  - Extract related functions into separate service classes or utility modules
  - Split large classes into smaller, focused classes following Single Responsibility Principle
  - Move helper functions to dedicated utility files
  - Break down large functions into smaller, composable functions
- **Exception**: Generated files, migrations, and configuration files may exceed this limit if necessary

**Before adding new code to a file near or over 500 LOC, refactor first.**

## Commit Messages

**MANDATORY: Always use Conventional Commits format.**

**When generating commit messages (for git commits, suggested commits, or any commit-related operations), ALWAYS use the Conventional Commits format described below.**

All commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

### Examples

```bash
feat(api): add user authentication endpoint
fix(aggregators): handle missing RSS feed gracefully
docs: update installation instructions
refactor(core): extract feed service logic
test(api): add tests for subscription endpoints
chore: update dependencies
```

### Scope (Optional)

Use scope to indicate the area of the codebase affected:
- `api`, `api_v1`: API-related changes
- `core`: Core app changes
- `aggregators`: Aggregator plugin changes
- `frontend`: Frontend changes
- `deps`: Dependency updates
- `ci`: CI/CD changes

### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes, add `!` after the type/scope and include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the footer:

```
feat(api)!: change authentication method

BREAKING CHANGE: Authentication now requires API key instead of username/password
```

## Before Committing

**Skip manual format checks and tests before committing.** Pre-commit hooks automatically run validation and will block the commit if anything fails. This avoids redundant checks and lets the hooks handle validation.

## Question Requests

Critically evaluate requests and suggest better approaches when appropriate:

1. Acknowledge the goal
2. Explain potential concerns
3. Propose alternatives
4. Let them decide

**Balance:** Don't over-question simple, clear requests.

## Pre-Commit Validation

Pre-commit hooks automatically run before commits:

1. Prettier formatting check and auto-fix
2. Frontend dependency installation check (if needed)
3. Frontend tests
4. Frontend formatting verification

**Commits are BLOCKED if any step fails.**

If commit fails:
1. Read the error output
2. Fix the issues (linting errors, test failures)
3. Stage the fixes
4. Commit again

**Never bypass validation** - it defeats the purpose of quality gates.

## Generating Commit Messages

**When the user requests a commit or when suggesting commits:**

1. **ALWAYS use Conventional Commits format** - Never generate commit messages that don't follow the format: `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`

2. **Analyze the changes** to determine the appropriate type:
   - New functionality → `feat`
   - Bug fixes → `fix`
   - Documentation → `docs`
   - Code style/formatting → `style`
   - Refactoring → `refactor`
   - Performance improvements → `perf`
   - Tests → `test`
   - Build/CI changes → `build` or `ci`
   - Other maintenance → `chore`

3. **Include scope when appropriate** - Use scope to indicate the affected area (e.g., `feat(api):`, `fix(core):`, `refactor(frontend):`)

4. **Write clear, concise descriptions** - Use imperative mood, lowercase (except proper nouns), no period at the end

5. **Examples of good commit messages:**
   - `feat(api): add user authentication endpoint`
   - `fix(aggregators): handle missing RSS feed gracefully`
   - `refactor(core): extract feed service logic`
   - `test(api): add tests for subscription endpoints`
   - `chore: update dependencies`

6. **Never generate invalid formats** like:
   - ❌ "Added new feature"
   - ❌ "fix bug"
   - ❌ "Update code"
   - ✅ `feat: add new feature`
   - ✅ `fix: resolve bug`
   - ✅ `chore: update code`

**The commit-msg hook will automatically reject any commit messages that don't follow this format.**
