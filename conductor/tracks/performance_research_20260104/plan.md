# Plan: Research Performance Improvements

## Phase 1: Database Performance Analysis [checkpoint: e8ad6c3]
- [x] Task: Audit aggregation logic and identified slow queries. (a4342c6)
- [x] Task: Evaluate database indexing strategy and suggest improvements. (64ef34b)
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: Database Performance Analysis' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Application Infrastructure & Resource Usage
- [x] Task: Measure application startup time and runtime memory consumption. (8e648da)
- [x] Task: Benchmark the aggregation process (fetching, parsing, and saving). (0701f6f)
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Application Infrastructure & Resource Usage' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: API & Frontend Responsiveness
- [ ] Task: Evaluate GReader API response times and identify bottlenecks.
- [ ] Task: Assess general frontend responsiveness and load times.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: API & Frontend Responsiveness' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 4: Track Creation & Reporting
- [ ] Task: Create "Refactor" or "Fix" tracks for all significant identified bottlenecks.
- [ ] Task: Compile a summary finding report in `conductor/tracks/performance_research_20260104/findings.md`.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 4: Track Creation & Reporting' (Protocol in workflow.md)
