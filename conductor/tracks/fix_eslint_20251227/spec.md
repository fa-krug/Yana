# Track Spec: Fix all ESLint errors and warnings

## Objective
To achieve a clean codebase by resolving all reported ESLint errors and warnings across the project.

## Scope
- Analyze the current ESLint output.
- Fix all errors and warnings in source files (`src/`).
- Fix all errors and warnings in configuration files.
- Verify that `npm run lint` completes without any output.

## Constraints
- Do not disable rules globally unless absolutely necessary and justified.
- Prefer refactoring code over suppressing warnings.
- Maintain existing functionality; this is a pure refactoring track.
