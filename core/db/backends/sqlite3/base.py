    Optimized SQLite database wrapper with performance PRAGMA settings.

    Extends Django's default SQLite backend to apply performance optimizations
    when database connections are established. Uses Django 6+ recommended approach
    via `init_connection_state()` method.

    Performance Optimizations Applied:
    - WAL mode (Write-Ahead Logging): Better concurrency, faster writes
    - Synchronous = NORMAL: Balanced safety and performance
    - Increased cache size (64MB): More data in memory, fewer disk reads
    - Memory-mapped I/O (256MB): Faster access to database file
    - Temp store in memory: Faster temporary operations
    - Busy timeout: Prevents lock contention
    - Foreign keys: Data integrity and query performance

        It's called both for new connections and when reusing connections from the pool,
